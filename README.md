# React Joyride test

This is code to test [React Joyride](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-joyride)
with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

```bash
# To start with create-react-app (webpack)
npm run cra-start

# To start with vite
npm run vite-dev
```

After you run both instances (CRA and vite) try to navigate between steps.
In the CRA instance it'd work but not in vite one.

The React Joyride code is located in `src/App.jsx`.
